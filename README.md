# Getting Started

This project is used to demonstrate in [Devera](https://devera.vn) Flutter course how to apply the Design Patterns in a Flutter application.

# Introduction

Design Patterns are very popular among software developers. A design pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.

Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:

1. Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can use in our java based projects.

2. Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.

3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

The Design Patterns are divided into three categories â€“ creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate an object in the best possible way for specific situations. Following design patterns come under this category.

- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects. Following design patterns come under this category.

- Adapter Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Decorator Pattern

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily. Following design patterns come under this category.

- Template Method Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Command Pattern
- State Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Memento Pattern
